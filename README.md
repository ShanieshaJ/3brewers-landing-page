# 3-brewers-landing-page

Creating this landing page of 3 Brewers (3 Brasseurs) for personal project for the month of April 2023 with Spring theme with the new limited time beer drink. This single page is designed by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This landing page will be responsive in all sizes.

# Lessons Learned

From what I learned from buliding this landing page is that learning the difference between using px and rem sizes in CSS since I always used px and %(percentage) for font-sizes, width, height, padding, margin, and etc in the page.
