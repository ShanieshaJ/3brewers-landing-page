# 3brewers-landing-page
Creating a landing page of 3 Brewers for SheCodes monthly challenge for the month of April with the theme of St. Patrick with the limited edition drink. The page is designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For now it is going to be on html file for the contest requirements. But will separate the CSS and JavaScript afterwards.
